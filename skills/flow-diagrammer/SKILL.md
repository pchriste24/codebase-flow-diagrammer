# Codebase Flow Diagrammer

## Purpose
Given a search term for a desired process, this skill will:
1. Investigate the codebase to identify the core flow/process
2. Trace entry points, dependencies, and execution paths
3. Generate a local interactive HTML page with a React Flow (xyflow) diagram
4. Include context, descriptions, high-level decisions, and clickable references to relevant code files

### Two diagram modes
The same template renders either mode — set `diagramType` in the data:

- **`"process"`** (default) — a flow that spans **multiple services**: routes,
  handlers, DB calls, external APIs. The original use case.
- **`"algorithm"`** — a **single service's** algorithm, decision tree, or control
  flow: branches, loops, guards, recursion, early returns within one function/module.

### Nested drill-down
A process node whose core logic is itself a non-trivial algorithm can carry a
`subDiagram` reference. In the rendered page that node is **drillable**: clicking it
zooms into a nested diagram (its own layout/sidebar/docs), with a breadcrumb to climb
back. This lets one artifact hold both the high-level flow **and** the algorithm
detail without cramming them onto one canvas. See "When to nest a sub-diagram" below.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request
- Get the process/search term from the user (e.g., "user signup flow", "payment processing", "order creation")
- Clarify scope if needed (frontend, backend, specific service)
- **Decide the mode.** If the target spans multiple services/endpoints → `"process"`.
  If it's the internal logic of a single function/module (an algorithm, a decision
  tree, a state machine) → `"algorithm"`. When in doubt, ask, or default to `process`
  and nest the algorithm as a sub-diagram (see Step 3).

### Step 2: Codebase Exploration
Use these tools in sequence. Pick the lens that matches the mode.

**Process mode — trace across services (the default lens):**

1. **Find entry points**: Search for routes, handlers, CLI commands, scheduled jobs related to the process
   - Use `grep`, `rg`, `find` to locate relevant files
   - Look for route definitions, controller actions, service entry points

2. **Trace the flow**:
   - Use Code Flow Tracer logic to map execution paths
   - Trace function calls, API endpoints, database queries, external service calls

3. **Identify components**:
   - List all services, modules, and files involved
   - Note data transformations at each step
   - Identify decision points and conditional branches

**Algorithm mode — trace control flow *within* one function/module:**

1. **Find the function**: locate the function/method and read it end to end. Note its
   signature (parameters → `inputs`) and every `return`/throw (→ `outputs`/terminals).
2. **Map control flow**, not service calls:
   - Each `if`/`switch`/ternary/guard clause → a `decision` node; label every branch
     ("true"/"false", case values, ranges).
   - Each `for`/`while`/`map`/recursion → a `loop` node; the edge that returns to the
     loop head is a **loop-back** edge (`loopBack: true`).
   - Guard clauses and early returns → `return`/`terminal` nodes.
   - Note preconditions/invariants the code assumes (→ `preconditions`).
3. **Estimate complexity** (time/space) if it's meaningful (→ `complexity`).
4. Keep nodes pointing at **line ranges within the one file** — in algorithm mode the
   "which file" matters less than "which lines."

### Step 3: Build the Flow Diagram Data
Create a structured JSON representation. The full schema is documented in the comment
at the top of `templates/flow-diagram.html`; the key fields:

**Always:**
- `processName`: title of the diagram
- `description`: one-line summary
- `projectRoot`: **absolute** path of the user's project (the working directory).
  Required for clickable code links — node `file` paths are stored relative to it,
  and the page opens them in VS Code via `vscode://file/<abs>:<line>`, which needs an
  absolute path. Fill this with the cwd (e.g. run `pwd`).
- `diagramType`: `"process"` (default) or `"algorithm"`
- `direction`: `"TB"` (default, top→bottom) or `"LR"` (left→right — better for wide
  decision trees)
- `nodes[]`: `{ id, label, type, file, line, description, subDiagram }`
- `edges[]`: `{ id, from, to, label, loopBack }`
  - `label`: branch text — "valid"/"invalid"/"true"/"false"/case values
  - `loopBack: true`: a loop-back/repeat edge (drawn dashed + cyan, animated)
- `decisions[]`: `{ id, label, file, line, branches:[{ when, then }] }`

**Sidebar/docs sections — include whichever fit (they render only when present):**
- `entryPoints[]`: `{ label, file, line }` (or a `"POST /x (file:line)"` string)
- `externalServices[]`: databases, APIs, third-party services (process mode)
- `inputs[]`: `{ name, type, description }` — function params (algorithm mode)
- `preconditions[]`: strings — guards/assumptions (algorithm mode)
- `outputs[]`: `{ name, type, description }` — return values (algorithm mode)
- `complexity`: `"O(n log n)"` or `{ time, space }` (algorithm mode)

**Node types:**
- process: `endpoint` · `logic` · `database` · `external-service` · `decision`
- algorithm: `start` · `terminal`/`return`/`end` · `logic` · `decision` · `loop` ·
  `input` · `output`

Positions are auto-computed (dagre) — **do not** supply `x`/`y`.

#### When to nest a sub-diagram
Emit a `subDiagram` when, while tracing a process, you hit a node whose internal logic
is a non-trivial algorithm that deserves its own explanation (e.g. a matching
algorithm, a ranking/scoring pass, a retry/backoff state machine). Instead of flattening
its 15 decision nodes into the high-level flow:

1. Keep the process node as one step, and add `"subDiagram": "<key>"` to it.
2. Add a top-level `subDiagrams` registry: `{ "<key>": <full flow-data object> }`.
   The nested object is a complete diagram in its own right — usually
   `"diagramType": "algorithm"` with its own `inputs`/`outputs`/`nodes`/`edges`.
3. Sub-diagrams may nest further (a sub-diagram node can reference another key).

Rule of thumb: if a single node would need more than ~5–6 internal steps to explain,
nest it rather than inlining. Keep each level readable.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "match", "label": "Match snapshot rows", "type": "logic",
      "file": "src/match.js", "line": 12, "subDiagram": "match-algo" }
  ],
  "subDiagrams": {
    "match-algo": {
      "processName": "Row-Matching Algorithm",
      "diagramType": "algorithm", "direction": "LR",
      "inputs": [ ... ], "outputs": [ ... ],
      "nodes": [ ... ], "edges": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Generate Interactive HTML with React Flow (docs-canvas style)

This skill **bundles** the HTML template. Do **NOT** build the HTML from scratch —
always start from the bundled template so output stays consistent.

1. Locate the bundled template at `templates/flow-diagram.html` **relative to this
   SKILL.md file** (i.e. the skill's own directory — the same directory this file
   lives in). Read it from there; it is not in the user's project.
2. Create an output directory in the **user's current working directory** (e.g.
   `./flow-diagrams/`) and copy the template to
   `./flow-diagrams/{process-name}-flow.html`. Never write generated files into the
   skill's install directory.
3. Replace the placeholder JSON inside the `<script id="flow-data">` block with the
   actual flow data (see the Step 3 schema and the template's header comment):
   - processName, description, diagramType, direction
   - nodes (with file:line, type, label; `subDiagram` where you nest)
   - edges (from, to, label, loopBack)
   - decisions, and the section data that fits (entryPoints/externalServices for
     process; inputs/preconditions/outputs/complexity for algorithm)
   - subDiagrams registry, if any node is drillable
4. The HTML is a single self-contained file (libraries load from CDN at runtime) —
   open it directly in a browser; no server needed (see Step 5).
5. Open the file for the user and tell them the path.

The data is injected via an embedded JSON `<script>` block that the page reads on load:

```html
<script id="flow-data" type="application/json">
{
  "processName": "User Signup Flow",
  "description": "Handles user registration from request to database persistence",
  "projectRoot": "/Users/you/projects/myapp",
  "diagramType": "process",
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...],
  "decisions": [...],
  "entryPoints": ["POST /api/auth/signup (src/routes/auth.js:45)"],
  "externalServices": ["PostgreSQL", "SendGrid", "Redis"],
  "subDiagrams": { "...": { "diagramType": "algorithm", "...": "..." } }
}
</script>
```

The generated page (docs-canvas style) includes:

- A fixed left sidebar with the title/description and a table-of-contents nav that
  adapts to the data (Entry Points / Inputs / Preconditions / Steps / Decision Points
  / Outputs / External Services — only those present), plus a clickable entry-points
  or inputs list and any external-dependency / complexity info
- A main area with the interactive React Flow diagram on top and detailed,
  anchored documentation sections below it
- Color-coded React Flow nodes by type:
  - endpoint: blue (#3b82f6) — pill
  - logic: green (#22c55e) — rectangle
  - database: orange (#f97316) — rectangle with DB icon
  - external-service: purple (#a855f7) — rectangle with external icon
  - decision: yellow diamond (#eab308)
  - start/terminal/return/end: stadium (teal / slate)
  - loop: cyan (#06b6d4), dashed
  - input/output: pink (#ec4899) / indigo (#6366f1)
- Clickable nodes (`openCodeFile(filePath, line)`) that open the file in **VS Code**
  via the `vscode://file/<abs>:<line>` handler (relative paths resolved against
  `projectRoot`); if `projectRoot` is missing it shows a message explaining why
- **Drillable nodes** (those with a `subDiagram`): a double border + `⤵` badge;
  clicking the body zooms into the nested diagram with a breadcrumb to climb back,
  while clicking the node's file:line still opens the code
- Hover tooltips showing file:line, context, and what the step does
- Edges labeled for branches ("valid"/"invalid"/"true"/"false"/cases); loop-back
  edges drawn dashed + cyan
- Zoom/pan, a minimap, and an "Export to PNG" button

### Step 5: Open the Diagram
The page loads everything from CDN and reads its data from an inline JSON block, so
it needs **no local web server** — just open the file:
- macOS: `open ./flow-diagrams/{process-name}-flow.html`
- Linux: `xdg-open ...`  ·  Windows: `start ...`
- Then give the user the file path so they can reopen it.
- Provide a summary of the flow in the chat.

**Fallback (rarely needed):** a few browsers (notably Firefox) are strict about
loading ES modules over `file://`. If the page comes up blank there, serve the
directory instead with the bundled helper (relative to this SKILL.md):
`bash bin/start-server.sh ./flow-diagrams` — it picks a random free port, prints a
`http://localhost:…` URL, and should be run in the background.

## Output Format

### In Chat (docs-canvas style):
```text
## {Process Name} Flow

I've analyzed the `{process}` flow and created an interactive diagram.

### Entry Points
- **POST /api/auth/signup** (`src/routes/auth.js:45`)
- **POST /api/auth/register** (`src/routes/auth.js:78`)

### Core Flow Steps
1. Validate input → AuthService.validate()
2. Create user → User.create()
3. Hash password → bcrypt.hash()
4. Save to DB → PostgreSQL users table
5. Send welcome email → SendGrid API

### Decision Points
- **Validate input**:
  - ✅ Valid email → Continue to create user
  - ❌ Invalid email → Return 400 error

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL (users table)
- SendGrid (welcome email)
- Redis (session cache)

### Interactive Diagram
Opened in your browser: **./flow-diagrams/{process}-flow.html**

Click nodes to open code in VS Code. Hover for context. Use the sidebar to navigate
sections, and click a node with a ⤵ badge to drill into its sub-diagram.
Export to PNG using the button in the diagram.
```

### HTML Page Features:
- Interactive React Flow (xyflow) diagram with zoom/pan and a minimap
- Two modes (process / algorithm) from one template, via `diagramType`
- Auto-layout (dagre) — no manual coordinates; handles loops/cycles; TB or LR
- Drill-down: click a node with a `subDiagram` to zoom in; breadcrumbs to climb back
- Adaptive sidebar + table-of-contents (sections render only when their data exists)
- Detailed documentation sections below the diagram
- Clickable code references that open files in the editor
- Color-coded node types with shape/icon per type (incl. start/terminal/loop/input/output)
- Hover tooltips with file:line and context
- Export to PNG

## Cursor Canvas Alternative (optional)

If the user is running this inside **Cursor IDE (3.1+ with the Canvas feature)**, offer to
generate a **Cursor Canvas** instead of a standalone HTML file. Canvas is a native,
React-based interactive UI that persists in the Agents Window with no local server.
When using Canvas, structure it like the HTML output:
- A table-of-contents section
- An architecture/flow diagram component
- Code reference blocks with clickable links
- Sections grouped by importance

If the user is **not** in Cursor IDE, use the standalone HTML approach above.

## Tools Used
- `grep`, `rg`, `find` -- for searching codebase
- `Read` -- for reading files
- `Bash` -- for copying the template, writing the diagram, and opening it in the browser

## Example Invocation
User: `/codebase-flow-diagrammer:flow "user payment processing"`

Result: Analyzes payment flow, writes and opens `./flow-diagrams/payment-processing-flow.html`
